<h4>Closure of Social Trail, by fallen Douglas Fir, Andrews Bay Trail,
Seward Park, Seattle</h4>

<p>
Video work log illustrates the completed work along a short section of
social trail off the Andrews Bay trail (MF2-area), Seward Park,
Seattle, Washington.  Work completed Dec 1, 2018 by Green City
Partnership forest stewards.  Although the social trail was short, it
had led to an extensive area that has been damaged by off-trail usage,
mainly by youth education groups.
