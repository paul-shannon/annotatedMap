  target="_blank">trail</a> connects two parks in southern Bainbridge Island - Fort Ward and Port
  Blakeley - maintained by the Bainbridge Island Metro Park and  Recreation District.  We first heard
  of sword fern die-off in the summer of 2017.  It is now quite extensive and quite severe.

<h5> Chronology</h5>
  <ul>

    <li><b>August 2017</b>: Darrell Howe made the first report: "Recently walked the trail from Fort Ward to Blakeley
      Harbor on Bainbridge and noticed what appears to be fern die-off."

    <li><b>March 2019</b>: Tim Billo reports "the situation along the trail above Blakely Harbor
    is astounding--although I can't say if it is better or worse since I had never visited
    before. It looks much like Seward Park did 3 years ago. Hundreds of dead ferns there in a large
    contiguous area, and smaller patches further up the trail."
