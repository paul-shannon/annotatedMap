    <li> <b> March 2019</b>, Tim Billo:
     <p> <i>the die-off at Islandwood seems quite a bit worse too &mdash; in that it has spread down
    the entire trail from their woods down to the harbor. I also discovered a patch that looked like
    an older die-off &mdash; ferns reduced to stubble, and a very bare understory like Seward's
    ground zero &mdash; so a site that may have been overlooked in the past.</i>
