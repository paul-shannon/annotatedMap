<b>This essay was our first effort to draw attention to the die-off:</b>

Ecologist Tim Billo, UW teacher and part-time stay-at-home dad,
noticed something strange three years ago on one of his frequent
visits to the Magnificent Forest at Seattleâ€™s Seward Park. This 100
acre forest, by a combination of good luck and good planning, has
never been logged. It is home to 500 year-old trees and nesting
eagles, to Douglas squirrels and pileated woodpeckers, to ravens and
the occasional coyote. It is a tiny remnant of the million acres of
ancient forest that covered the Puget Lowlands after the retreat of
the glaciers 15,000 years ago. With his one-year-old daughter in a
sturdy stroller, walking up the Hatchery Trail, Tim noticed that a
hillside previously covered with waist-high sword ferns was now
entirely bare. All the ferns were dead.

Tim's daughter is now four years old. The sword fern die-off Tim first
noticed three ago has spread rapidly, now covering ten acres. By the
time his daughter is in her teens, extrapolating from current rates of
spread, very few ferns will be left in the 120 acres of rare and
beautiful urban old growth forest.

Not only are the ferns dying: the new bare regions, emptied of ferns,
are not regenerating. No new plants, neither weeds nor native species,
have sprouted in the bare ground left by the dying ferns. So as the
ferns die, the understory structure of the forest disappears, and the
overall structure of the forest - its interwoven ecology - is
compromised. Tim's daughter, by the time she is a young woman, may
find that the Magnificent Forest at Seward Park is but a weak and
reduced version of what, for centuries, it has been. We will lose an
intricate and beautiful ancient plant and animal community, that rare
wonderful thing, a wilderness in the city.

Tim joined with an ad hoc network of volunteers including amateur
citizen naturalists, the Friends of Seward Park (including the
author), UW ecologist Patrick Tobin, UW undergraduates, the staff of
the WSU Puyallup Plant and Insect Diagnostic Laboratory, and plant
ecologist Lisa Cieko from Seattle Parks. We scoured the reference
literature, consulted fern experts, cultured and sequenced DNA from
plant tissue and soil samples, measured soil nitrogen, monitored
mountain beavers and insect activity. After three years and the death
of hundreds of ferns, and in the presence of its continuing spread, no
cause has been found, and no remedy is available.
