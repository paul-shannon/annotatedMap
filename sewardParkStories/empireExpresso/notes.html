My seven-year-old goddaughter and I sit in a caf√©, more than a mile
from Seward Park, but still holding Sqebeqsed in mind. I read
her <a href="http://www.washington.edu/uwired/outreach/cspn/Website/Classroom%20Materials/Reading%20the%20Region/Northwest%20Schools%20of%20Literature/Commentary/18.html">Denise Levertov's poem "Settling."</a> She tips her head at the line

  Grey is the price 
  of neighboring with eagles.

This child has always lived close to eagles, always cupped small hands
around her eyebrows on sunny days and complained of rays piercing her
eyes. She is confused. How is that a price? she wants to know.
